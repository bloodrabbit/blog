Xcode 8.0 GM is now available! ðŸŽ‰


__Notes__: This is the first Xcode version which includes the new `iPhone 7` and `iPhone 7 Plus`
simulators, which you can now set as the test device e.g. in the `Xcode Test` step (on the Xcode 8 stack)!


__To select this Stack__ you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8 beta`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.0 beta (GM) stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 8.0 beta configuration,
so **if you've already selected the Xcode 8 Beta stack for your app,
you're automatically using the GM now**.

__You can find the Stack's__ full __system report__ at:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log),
and the changes compared to the previous beta stack:

If you'd like to add a tool to be pre-installed on our Stacks
you can find all the required information at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed).

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
