## Highlights

Bitrise CLI 1.4.5 is now installed on all of the VMs.
1.4.5 was only a quickfix release, no new features were added
compared to 1.4.4. To see what's new in Bitrise CLI 1.4.4 and 1.4.5 see:
[Monthly release of Bitrise CLI (Nov)](/2016/11/09/monthly-release-of-bitrise-cli-nov.html)

Other Bitrise VM tools were also updated (`bitrise-bridge` and `cmd-bridge`),
mostly just for dependency updates
and to recompile with the latest Go version.

_For full list of changes please check the `diff` of the stacks below!_

## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the macOS stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `macOS stacks -> Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates, Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend, except the `LTS` (Long Term Support) stacks.
