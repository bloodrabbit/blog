> **Status**: the virtual machine update is now **finished**.

*We now have the new virtual machine prepared and it
passed our initial tests, so we now have the pre-installed tool
version change list, we expect this to be the complete list of updates.*

There's only two pre-installed tool version change this time:

* Xcode 7.1 beta 2 will replace beta 1
* NodeJS updated from `v4.1.0` to `v4.1.1`

We might add an additional, minor `bitrise CLI` update in case
we can finalize the new release in time (in the next 1-2 days).


## Schedule & Status

**Status**: the virtual machine update is now **finished**.

times might be longer while we disconnect a set of
builder machines for the update.*
