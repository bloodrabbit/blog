A new LIFX smart bulb step is finally available again!

_There was a previous LIFX step in the StepLib before, but the
maintainer of the step stopped its development and decided to even
delete the repository, which ultimately made us to remove the step
from the StepLibrary._

Fortunately for LIFX fans [@vgaidarji](https://github.com/vgaidarji)
stepped up and published an updated version of the [step](https://github.com/vgaidarji/steps-lifx-notifier)!

The name of the new step in the StepLib is `LIFX Notifier` (or step id `lifx-notifier`,
if you prefer to work with `bitrise.yml`),
and this is an updated version of the previous LIFX step,
which includes quite a few revisions too!

__We owe a huge thanks to [@vgaidarji](https://github.com/vgaidarji)
and for everybody who contributed a step, you make the ecosystem
better for everyone!__

If you'd decide to contribute a new step
