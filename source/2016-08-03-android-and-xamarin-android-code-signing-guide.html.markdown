We've created a new, more detailed, step by step guide for Android (including Xamarin Android)
code signing. You can find it [on our new DevCenter](https://bitrise-io.github.io/devcenter/tutorials/create-signed-apk-on-bitrise/).

__About the new DevCenter__

We're working on moving from our current DevCenter to this new one.
For now we host the new DevCenter as a GitHub pages website,
but eventually it'll replace [devcenter.bitrise.io](http://devcenter.bitrise.io)
as the primary / official DevCenter.

_Why do we move the DevCenter?_ One of the primary reasons
is that it is now completely __open source__, you can find the DevCenter's code
[on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/devcenter) - __feel free to edit
any page__, you can do that directly on GitHub (you can do it directly on the GitHub web UI, by opening
any file and clicking the _pencil_ button)!

There are other reasons, both technical (the whole DevCenter can be generated
as a static website, using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)) and user experience (e.g. better search)
related.

As part of the transition we're also performing reviews on the existing DevCenter
pages, to make sure we don't have outdated docs on the new DevCenter - that's
why it takes more time to clomplete the transition.

We think the new DevCenter will be an improvement for every __Bitrise__ user,
even if you don't want to contribute / correct anything.
If you have any feedback, feel free to create an issue on the
[DevCenter's GitHub page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/devcenter).

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
