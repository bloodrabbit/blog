As there was no significant tool version change in the last week
we decided not to do a virtual machine update this week.

We already have the **latest Xcode versions, both 6.2 (stable) and 6.3 beta 3**
preinstalled on the current virtual machines
and there were only point release updates for the other
preinstalled tools.

We're still experimenting with the perfect virtual machine
update schedule to provide an up-to-date but also stable and
reliable environment for your automation workflows.

We'll follow the weekly update schedule if there's any
significant tool update available but in other case
we'll probably switch to bi-weekly updates.

**Let us know what you think, how frequent the
updates should be.**
