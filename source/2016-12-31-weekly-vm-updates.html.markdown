## Highlights

Pretty much the only thing worth to mention is the latest
Ruby release, `2.4.0`, which broke so many Ruby gems that we
had to decide to not to upgrade to it anywhere.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this means
that we could not do a usual full rebuild of the Xcode Edge stack,
it only received the dependency manager cache updates like the other Xcode
stacks. Next week we'll keep an eye on how things progress and will
find a solution - either by upgrading gems to versions which work with
Ruby 2.4.0 on the Edge stack, or by fixing the Ruby version to 2.3.x for a while.

_For the full list of changes please check the `diff` of the stacks below._

## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the macOS stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `macOS stacks -> Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates, Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend, except the `LTS` (Long Term Support) stacks.
