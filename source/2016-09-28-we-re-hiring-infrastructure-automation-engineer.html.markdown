![Infra](infra.png)

Bitrise's infrastructure is the heart of our service. Our build machines are humming in cold rooms 24/7 to run builds for thousands of companies, making developers' lives easier. We're looking for someone, who will take care of these machines, keep them happy, give them virtual back rubs once in a while and oil their non-existent cogs to make them run better. ðŸ› 
*Automate everything!* is an expression you'll hear often working here, so you have to be keen to automate things and only do anything manually when it's really required. ðŸ¤–

##On typical days, you'll do:

- **Automation:** scripting, Virtual Machine template creation/management (MacOS and Ubuntu), Docker image creation, release management / roll out management of Virtual Machines
- **Experimenting:** performance tweaking & reliability tuning
- **Monitoring:** log aggregation through clusters of servers (Virtual Machines), with alerting and anomaly detection, issue fixing
- Do lots of things in the open (open source)

##You'll mainly use:

- VMware vSphere (mainly through its API)
- Google Compute Engine  (mainly through its API)

##You must have:

- Good English language skills
- Linux (mainly Ubuntu) and/or MacOS experience
- Scripting in at least two languages: Ruby, Python, Bash, Go, etc.

##Big plus if you have experience with:

- Configuration management tools: we mainly use Ansible and Packer
- Virtualization tools, like Vagrant, Docker or any other (VirtualBox, Parallels, etc.)
- Cloud configuration / management tools, like Google Compute Engine command line tool, or experience with any other cloud environment CLI
- Open source development
- Release management
- Continuous Integration and Delivery
- We like you a bit more, if you have mobile development experience, because significant part of the job is working on creating/managing build environments for mobile developers

##About Bitrise

Bitrise is a Continuous Integration and Delivery platform focusing on mobile development. We help developers to automate their every-day tasks so they can go back to building great apps and have more time for their ideas. We'd like to create an ecosystem for software developers which they can use to build, test and distribute their apps in a way that it feels natural and fun. We take being open very seriously and we love to automate everything!

##Why you should join

We are a small, but extremely motivated team with a rapidly growing product and userbase. Everyone in the team has meaningful and important tasks, whatever you do will make a difference and whatever your ideas may be, it will be heard. We like to look at people's trajectories rather than their status when looking for talent. We'd like to find people who will be with us on the long run while growing and improving with us.
