## Summary

This week's most most significant change is that we added a new Stack option:
`Xcode 8.1.x`. This Stack, just like the `Xcode 8.0.x` one, will be
updated to have the latest Xcode 8.1 version, including the betas.
Right now Xcode 8.1 beta 1 is installed on the Stack.

__This is a new Stack__, which means that
__you'll have to select it manually__
for your app if you want to use it (you can change your app's stack on its `Settings` tab)!

Also, as noted in Xcode 8.1 beta's [Release Notes](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_8.1_beta/Release_Notes_for_Xcode_8.1_beta.pdf),
__a couple of simulators are missing__, namely:

- iOS: 10.0, 9.3
- watchOS: 3.0, 2.2
- tvOS: 10.0, 9.2

You can see what's new in this Stack compared to the Xcode 8.0.x stack
[in this GitHub diff](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/pull/72/commits/27f8068b030022ed06093ca2e8328a20ffd4272a),
and the full system report of the stack [here](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.1.x.log).


## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the OS X stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `OS X Stacks: Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates, Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend, except the `LTS` (Long Term Support) stacks.
