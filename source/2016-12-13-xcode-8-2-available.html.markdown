Xcode 8.2 (final) is now available! ðŸŽ‰


__Notes__: No significant changes, the performance of 8.2 is about the same as beta 2's,
which is significantly faster (for Swift projects) than 8.0 or 8.1 was.


__To select this Stack__ you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8.2.x`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.2 stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 8.2 (beta 2) configuration,
so __if you've already selected the Xcode 8.2.x stack for your app, you're automatically using Xcode 8.2 (final) now__.

__You can find the Stack's__ full __system report__ at:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.2.x.log](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.2.x.log),

If you'd like to add a tool to be pre-installed on our Stacks

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
