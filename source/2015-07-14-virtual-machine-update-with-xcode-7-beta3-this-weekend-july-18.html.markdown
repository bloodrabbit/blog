We now have the new virtual machine prepared and it
passed our initial tests so we now have the exact tool
version change list, we expect this to be the complete list of updates.

The only significant change will be the Xcode 7 upgrade
from beta 2 to the latest, beta 3.


## Schedule & Status

**Status**: the virtual machine update is now **finished**.
Our tests did finish successfully, we don't know about any issue related to the update.

The Virtual Machine update is scheduled for **Saturday, July 18, 2015**,
we'll update this section with the status of the update.

*We don't expect any downtime during the update, but build queue
times might be longer while we disconnect a set of
builder machines for the update.*
