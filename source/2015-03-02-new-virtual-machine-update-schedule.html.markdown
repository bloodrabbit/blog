Lately new Xcode beta versions are popping quite frequently
in preparation for Apple Watch, and our beloved Swift
gets updated in almost every new Xcode beta version as well.

Our current Virtual Machine update schedule is not really ideal in these fast changing
times, additionally quite a lot of you have requested
Xcode beta version support for Xcode point releases.

To address these concerns and to provide you the
best environment even if you develop for up-and-coming
platforms like Apple Watch we'll change our Virtual Machine update schedule.

Starting this week we plan to release Virtual Machine updates
every week. The exact schedule will look something like this:

* At the beginning of the week (mostly on Monday) we'll prepare the new Virtual Machines which will contain the latest stable Xcode version and the latest beta version too.
* During the week we'll test the new Virtual Machine internally to ensure it's stable enough for the release.
* At the end of the week we'll release the new Virtual Machines into our production environment. We plan to do this on the weekends, preferably on Saturday.

With this schedule we hope that we can provide a stable environment for those
who use stable release versions of Xcode and also provide quick support for those
who experiment or develop with beta versions.
