![Schedule build update](schedule_update.png)

Just a few weeks have passed since you can edit your scheduled builds, but we have already implemented some really cool new features which makes scheduling even more useful.

##Trigger schedules whenever 🚀

Maybe you thought that being on schedule was the most important thing, but not anymore. You can now immediately start a build with its preset configuration by clicking on "Trigger now" button. No need to go through the cumbersome process of resetting the time to test out that specific config.

##Disable nightlies & use them for build templates 🎚🎚🎚

You can now disable or enable every scheduled build you've created. This means not only that you don't want to run them automatically for a while (which is also useful), but that you can also use them like a "Build Templates". You can create a multiple build templates with different configurations and you can run them whenever you want. Now that's killing two birds with one stone. 🐦🐦
