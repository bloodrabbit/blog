Xcode 8.1 beta 2 is now available! ðŸŽ‰


__Notes__: The same iOS Simulators are available (and missing) as in beta 1.
Although beta 2's Release Notes state that it should now support the iOS 10 Simulators,
if you try to install those from Xcode 8.1 beta 2 you'll get a "network error", regardless
of how many times you try to install it, while the other Simulators install without any issue.
_iOS 10.1 Simulators are of course available, but not the iOS 10.0 ones._


__To select this Stack__ you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8.1.x`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.1 stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 8.1 (beta 1) configuration,
so **if you've already selected the Xcode 8.1.x stack for your app,
you're automatically using the final Xcode 8.1 now**.
