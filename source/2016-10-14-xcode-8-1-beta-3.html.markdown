Xcode 8.1 beta 3 is now available! ðŸŽ‰


__Notes__: The same iOS Simulators are available (and missing) as in beta 2.
If you try to install those from Xcode 8.1 beta 3 you'll get a "network error", regardless
of how many times you try to install it, while the other Simulators install without any issue.
_iOS 10.1 Simulators are of course available, but not the iOS 10.0 ones._


__To select this Stack__ you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8.1.x`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.1 stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 8.1 (beta 2) configuration,
so __if you've already selected the Xcode 8.1.x stack for your app, you're automatically using Xcode 8.1 beta 3 now__.

__You can find the Stack's__ full __system report__ at:
