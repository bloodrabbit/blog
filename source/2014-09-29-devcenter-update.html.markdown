We've rolled out a huge revision of our [DevCenter](http://devcenter.bitrise.io).
It's still not complete (well, as it's usual with any kind of software it never will be :))
but hopefully the articles now cover all the basics of using Bitrise
and some tips and tricks to make your build automation even better.

You can fork the [DevCenter repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/devcenter)
if you want to add your own [tutorial](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/tutorials/community-created/)
or if you find any issues or typos.
