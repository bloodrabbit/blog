The virtual machines are now updated to include the
fix we mentioned in our [previous blog post](/2015/03/09/amazon-s3-network-issues-patch-coming-with-a-new-virtual-machine-update.html) and we
did not detect any issues since the update.

The virtual machine update contains two pre-installed tool
version upgrade as well:

* git: 2.3.1 -> 2.3.2
* xctool: 0.2.2 -> 0.2.3

As always if you have a suggestion for new tools to be pre-installed
on the Virtual Machines [contact us](https://www.bitrise.io/contact?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=bitrise){:target="_blank"}
and if it's reasonable to have the tools built into the virtual machines
then the next update will already contain the new tools.

## Next virtual machine update date

The next virtual machine update is scheduled for the end of
next week: **Saturday, March 21, 2015**
