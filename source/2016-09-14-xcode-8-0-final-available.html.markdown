Xcode 8.0 (final) is now available! ðŸŽ‰


__Notes__: This stack now runs Bitrise CLI `1.4.0`, the other stacks will be updated
with the new CLI this weekend.


__To select this Stack__ you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8.0.x`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.0 stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 8.0 (GM) configuration,
so **if you've already selected the Xcode 8.0.x stack for your app,
you're automatically using the final Xcode 8.0 now**.

__You can find the Stack's__ full __system report__ at:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log),
and the changes compared to the previous beta stack:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/commit/01a91e76eebb8a62f161f3834e46f3e18d9b45c4](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/commit/01a91e76eebb8a62f161f3834e46f3e18d9b45c4).

If you'd like to add a tool to be pre-installed on our Stacks
you can find all the required information at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed).

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
