Xcode 7.3 beta 2 is now available [on the New Stacks](http://blog.bitrise.io/2016/01/20/here-comes-the-new-stack.html).

To select this Stack you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 7.3 beta, on OS X 10.11`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 7.3 beta stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 7.3 beta 1 configuration,
so if you've already selected this Xcode Beta stack (when beta 1 came out) for your app
you're automatically using beta 2 now.

You can find the Stack's description on our [DevCenter](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/infrastructure/available-stacks/#section-xcode-7-3-beta-on-os-x-10-11), the full system report at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-7.3-beta.log](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-7.3-beta.log),
and the changes since the beta 1 stack: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/commit/0506d99c09484b181ce20207229112232554c18e](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/commit/0506d99c09484b181ce20207229112232554c18e).

This new configuration also has [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) pre-installed,
which was contributed by [@kylejm](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/pull/4)
(we're still working on the Stack Pull Request checks ðŸ˜‰).

If you'd like to add a tool to be pre-installed on our Stacks
you can find all the required information at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed).
