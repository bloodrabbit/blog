## Highlights

__Xamarin and Xcode Edge__: Xcode 8.2.1 is now the preinstalled Xcode version on all Xamarin stacks (except the LTS one),
as well as on the Xcode Edge stack.

__Xamarin__ stacks were also updated to the latest Xamarin channel updates.

The __Android__ stack received one more Emulator related update,
[the `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables are now set by default](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/android/pull/49/files),
to allow the latest Android Emulators to boot in both window and `-no-window` mode,
without any customization in your build configuration.


_For full list of changes please check the `diff` of the stacks below!_

## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the macOS stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `macOS stacks -> Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates, Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend, except the `LTS` (Long Term Support) stacks.
