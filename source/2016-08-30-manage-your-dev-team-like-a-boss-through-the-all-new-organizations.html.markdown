As your company is getting bigger, managing your team of developers, testers and project managers becomes more and more troublesome. This is why we felt, that an enhanced version of team handling is needed - and we delivered! You can now feel like one big family. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

Feeling eager to try it out already? [Click here](https://www.bitrise.io/me/profile#/create_organization) to create your first organization!

##Designed for productivity

The problem with the current team handling is that you have to add the same people to every app you add to Bitrise, which is unacceptable. With Organizations, you can create groups, which you can assign to app teams easily, with just a few clicks (four, to be exact). üí•, that's taken care of.

We suggest creating different groups for each role type (Admin, Developer, Tester). You can make it a bit more sophisticated by creating different ones for each platform type, like `iOS Developers` or `Android Developers`. But who are we to tell you how to live your life? You can as easily name them `Team Valor`, `Team Mystic` and `Team Instinct`, we won't tell anyone.

##Team-wide benefits üêô

Previously, all power was held by the app owner, since only they could manage billing and add apps to the paying account. Now any member of an organization can add apps to them and feel like they are the boss.
It's also possible to add multiple owners to your organization, because we know that there are more than one responsible people working in your company. Owners are still the only people who can delete apps and manage billing details.

##Org for the Pros ‚ö°Ô∏è

**Organizations is a Pro only feature**, but since there's no way for us to transfer your billing details, **we are giving you 1 month of trial for your first organization,** to make the transition easier. You can sign up for the 1-month trial for the next 2 months, after that everything will go back to normal, and users will receive 2 weeks of trial for their first org.

We've created a [short FAQ](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/v1.0/docs/organization-faq) to help you make sense of Organizations at start, but if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to us!
