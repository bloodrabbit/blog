This feature was under development for quite a while, but it's finally here to stay!

__What is Skip CI?__

In short: from now on if you include the text `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` in your
commit message and push it, that commit won't start a build.

You can find all the details you might wish for [on our new DevCenter](https://bitrise-io.github.io/devcenter/tips-and-tricks/skip-a-build/).

__A huge thanks goes to [@tume](https://github.com/tume)__, who sent us the Pull Request with
the implementation of the feature,
[and to all of those who contributed to the discussion or supported this feature](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-webhooks/pull/8)!
