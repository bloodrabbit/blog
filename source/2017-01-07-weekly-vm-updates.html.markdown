## Highlights

- Preinstalled `cordova` and `ionic` CLIs (`npm install -g`) on the __Android/Linux stack__ ([pr](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/android/pull/54/files)) and on the __Xcode Edge stack__ ([pr](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/pull/31/files)).
- For now we don't preinstall Ruby 2.4 anywhere, not even on the Edge stack, as it has too many issues (see [this CocoaPods issue report](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/6299) for example). Instead we opted to preinstall `homebrew/versions/ruby23` ([pr](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/pull/30/files)) on new macOS Stacks for now.
- Xamarin Alpha update to [https://releases.xamarin.com/alpha-preview-7-cycle-9/](https://releases.xamarin.com/alpha-preview-7-cycle-9/)

## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the macOS stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `macOS stacks -> Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates, Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend, except the `LTS` (Long Term Support) stacks.
