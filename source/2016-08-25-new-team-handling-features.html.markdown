As you've probably noticed already, we've made a slight redesign on the Team tab, preparing for the upcoming Organization support. We'd like to highlight a few noteworthy improvements, so you wouldn't miss a thing.

##Get rid of those email notifications 🙈

Most likely the best of the bunch is the Watch/Unwatch feature, released just yesterday. If you got frustrated before by the flood of build emails and deploy notifications, we've mixed just the right medicine for you. One click on the Unwatch button and 💥 your pain is gone. You won't ever get neither a build email, nor a your-app-is-ready-to-install one. Just find the app that annoys you most and make it silent once and for all. 🔫

##UDID list 📱

You can now download the full list of UDIDs of your registered team members' test devices to create Provisioning Profiles for the whole team. A little bit of extra niceness to help you with iOS code signing.

##Connected user moved 🚚

We've moved the connected service credential user setting to the Team tab, because the poor thing felt out of place under Settings. We have to make sure everyone feels part of the Team. Get it?

##Easier to invite new members 🙋

We've eliminated the role dropdown and wisely replaced it with three buttons, each for one role (Admin, Developer, Tester). From now on, you can add new members to your team with one less click. It's so fast, you're almost traveling back in time. ⚡️ We've also made a Role Cheatsheet, if you ever feel unsure about what kind of rights each role has.
