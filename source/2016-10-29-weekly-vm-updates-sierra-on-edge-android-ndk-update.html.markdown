## Highlights

We finally managed to update every core step for macOS Sierra,
and __the current `Xcode Edge` stack is now built on top of macOS Sierra__, with
Xcode 8.0 installed on it (at the time we prepared it Xcode 8.1 was still
just in GM, next week Edge will have Xcode 8.1 final).

A couple of notes: Sierra changed a few things, especially for keychain management,
so if you want to use the new Edge stack you'll have to upgrade the
`Certificate and profile installer` step to the latest version.
Otherwise your build will __"hang"__ when Xcode tries to sign your code,
due to a permission popup, where you should manually click "Allow".
The latest `Certificate and profile installer` step
has a fix for this, enabling the installed certificates to be used
without manual intervention. _This might affect other tools as well unless they were upgraded
to handle the change Sierra brought!_

Unfortunately __`xctool` had to be removed from the Edge stack__,
as it seems it's not (yet) compatible with macOS Sierra,
at least not how `brew` installs it. Of course you can install `xctool`
yourself if you want to, just like [any other tool which is not preinstalled](https://bitrise-io.github.io/devcenter/tips-and-tricks/install-additional-tools/).

__The Android/Linux stack__ was updated to have the latest
Android NDK, thanks to [@mickele](https://github.com/mickele)'s
[Pull Request](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/android-ndk/pull/19).
Additionally he also added [Android Studio's CMake as a preinstalled tool](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/android-ndk/pull/20).
Thanks [@mickele](https://github.com/mickele) for your help! ðŸš€

Last but not least, __Xamarin__ stacks were updated to use
the latest Xamarin versions, just like every week when a new
Xamarin update is released.

_For full list of changes please check the `diff` of the stacks below!_

## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the macOS stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `macOS stacks -> Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates, Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend, except the `LTS` (Long Term Support) stacks.
