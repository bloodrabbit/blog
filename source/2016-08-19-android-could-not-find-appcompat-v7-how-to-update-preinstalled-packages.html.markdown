If you'd get an error in your Android build like:

<pre><code>Could not find com.android.support:appcompat-v7:24.2.0. 
</code></pre>

or:

<pre><code>You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK components:
</code></pre>

it means that your Android build requires an Android package which is either not (yet) preinstalled
(_you can see which packages are preinstalled [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/android/blob/master/Dockerfile#L30) -
feel free to send us a Pull Request if you'd want to add a new preinstalled package!_),
__or outdated__.

__How to fix these errors?__

It's quite simple, you just have to update or install the related Android package.
You can do this with a `Script` step (_can be the first step in the Workflow_),
just specify this as the content of the `Script` step to update the
packages related to the errors above:

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# fail if any commands fails 
set -e 
# debug log 
set -x

# write your script here 
echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter extra-android-support | grep 'package installed' 
echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter extra-android-m2repository | grep 'package installed'
echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter extra-google-m2repository | grep 'package installed'
</code></pre>
