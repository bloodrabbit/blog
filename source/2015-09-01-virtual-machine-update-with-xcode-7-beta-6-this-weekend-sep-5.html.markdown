> **Status**: the virtual machine update is now **finished**.

We now have the new virtual machine prepared and it
passed our initial tests, so we now have the pre-installed tool
version change list, we expect this to be the complete list of updates.

List of upgraded pre-installed tools:

* installed with Homebrew:
    * __git__: `2.5.0` -> `2.5.1`
    * __xctool__: `0.2.4` -> `0.2.5`
    * __go__: `1.4.2` -> `1.5`
* __Xcode__:
    * __-beta__: `7.0 beta 5 (build version: 7A176x)` -> `7.0 beta 6 (build version: 7A192o)`

There are two new "mysterious" additions as well - the final pre-installed version
might change if we have to release patches while we're testing the new VM:

* [bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise){:target="_blank"}: **new**, `0.9.11`
* [bitrise-bridge](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-bridge){:target="_blank"}: **new**, `0.9.2`
* [cmd-bridge](https://github.com/bitrise-io/cmd-bridge){:target="_blank"}: `v0.9.2` -> `0.9.3`

*Update: we had to patch `bitrise-bridge` and `cmd-bridge`, versions changed.*

We'll share more information about these new tools at the end of the weekend ðŸ˜‰
