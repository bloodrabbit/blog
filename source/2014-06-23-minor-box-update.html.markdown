## What changed?

New Environment Variables for special Step related folders and files:

- $BITRISE_FOLDER_PATH: base Bitrise folder
- $BITRISE_STEP_DATA_FOLDER_PATH: Step data folder
- $BITRISE_STEP_FORMATTED_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH: Formatted Step output file

*You don't have to create these folders, these are part of the new OS X Box.*

> For a list of default available Environment Variables check out the Bitrise Dev Center's [Available Environment Variables](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/faq/available-environment-variables/){:target="_blank"} page


### What is this Formatted Step Output file?

It's a special Markdown file. If this file is generated by a Step (at the *$BITRISE_STEP_FORMATTED_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH* path) Bitrise will detect it and store it for the Step and present it on the Build Details page alongside with the Step's log output.

Our **System Information Reporter** Step has been updated to generate a formatted output for the more important details. Right now it looks like this:

As usual you can check out the Step's [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-system-info-reporter).
