__Xcode 8.2 beta 1 is now available__, on the new, `Xcode 8.2.x` stack!

__This is a new Stack__, which means that __you'll have to select it manually__
for your app if you want to use it (you can change your app's stack on its `Settings` tab)!

You can see what's new in this Stack compared to the Xcode 8.1.x stack
[in this GitHub diff](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/pull/88/commits/b54a640c87081eb85bf7affad5801c9a43e365d1),
and the full system report of the stack [here](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.2.x.log).

## Stack / System Reports

on GitHub: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports).

If you'd like to add additional tools to be pre-installed you can find the
instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed-on-a-build-machine),
for both the Linux and for the OS X stacks.

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
