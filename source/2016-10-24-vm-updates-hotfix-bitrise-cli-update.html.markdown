## Highlights

All VMs now have `Bitrise CLI 1.4.3` preinstalled, which includes a fix
for the random `panic: runtime error` [issue](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/issues/431).

The [1.4.3 release](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/tag/1.4.3) includes
only two additional, minor changes:

* We replaced the emojis previously used as the steps' result (success/error) indicator with standard
  unicode characters, as the emojis caused layouting issues (on system the emojis were treated as
  2 character long, while on others as 3 character long). This means that the step result log lines
  should now be presented correctly and the same way on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) and if you run the build
  locally in your Terminal / Command Line with the [Bitrise CLI](https://www.bitrise.io/cli).
* The built in Go toolkit of the CLI was bumped to use Go 1.7.3

You can find the [full release log on the CLI's GitHub page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/tag/1.4.3).

No other change was performed, but as usual we publish the full
system report list for every stack below.


## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the OS X stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `OS X Stacks: Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates, Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend, except the `LTS` (Long Term Support) stacks.

## Stack / System Reports

You can find the full system report of all of the available Stacks
on GitHub: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports).

If you'd like to add additional tools to be pre-installed you can find the
instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed-on-a-build-machine),
for both the Linux and for the OS X stacks.
