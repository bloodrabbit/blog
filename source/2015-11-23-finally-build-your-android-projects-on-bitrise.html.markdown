We are proud to announce the Android support on [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io). As of today we are starting the **public beta period**, which means that you can add your Android projects the same way as the iOS ones and start building, deploying and being happy.


##What does Beta mean in this case?


We are working hard to hash out the details. We want it to be as awesome and easy to use as our iOS support, and for that we'll need a few more Build Steps / Integrations. During the last couple of weeks of the private beta, we received helpful feedback and a couple of Pull Requests for our existing Android Steps. You can find helpful Docs and Guides for the Android support on our [DevCenter](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/android/android-tips-and-tricks/).

All the Steps are [open source](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib/tree/master/steps), so feel free to create new Steps or modify the existing ones. We've just created a legendary **Contributor sticker**, which will be received by people who - yes, you guessed it right - contribute to any of our open source tools / Steps. It is pretty badass, too! ðŸ˜Ž

>Beta also means that there might be breaking changes in the VM/Image setup (what is installed & where). We try our best not to introduce breaking changes, unless we really have to, and we'll add new build machines as needed. [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitrise) for VM updates!


With that said, we feel that this current version is smooth enough for everyone to try out, you just have to be prepared for frequent changes and improvements ðŸ˜‰
